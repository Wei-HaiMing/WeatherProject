The program can be run on powershell with the command flask --app weather.py --debug run
This will give you the link for the website Otter Weather. When you get to the home page it will ask you to enter any City you would like to search the weather conditions of 
and it will take you the details page where it will give you the detail such as temperature both in degrees Farenheight and Celsius as well as the wind speed.
In the future we will like to enter functionality that doesn't require entering a city but rather use location where you can enter the route which displays how the weather conditions 
change throughout your trip.
